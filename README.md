ResistanceGA
============

<<<<<<< HEAD
An R package to optimize resistance surfaces using Genetic Algorithms. Both continuous and categorical surfaces can be optimized using these functions. Additionally, it is possible to simultaneously optimize multiple resistance surfaces at the same time to generate novel resistance surfaces.

To install this package, execute the following commands in R:

```
install.packages("devtools") # Installs the 'devtools' package
library(devtools) # Loads devtools

install_github("wpeterman/ResistanceGA") # Downloads package
require(ResistanceGA) # Installs package and the other required packages needed
```
