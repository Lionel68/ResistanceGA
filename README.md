ResistanceGA
============

### An R package to optimize resistance surfaces using Genetic Algorithms. Both continuous and categorical surfaces can be optimized using these functions. Additionally, it is possible to simultaneously optimize multiple resistance surfaces at the same time to generate novel resistance surfaces.    

To install this package, execute the following commands in R:

```
install.packages("devtools") # Installs the 'devtools' package
library(devtools) # Loads devtools

install_github("wpeterman/ResistanceGA") # Downloads package
require(ResistanceGA) # Installs package and the other required packages needed
```
Once the package is installed, you can further explore the functions by opening the HTML 'Vignette' using the code below, or you can view the vignette directly [**here**](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23513016/ResistanceGA_Vignette.html "Vignette")
```
vignette('ResistanceGA_Vignette')  # Opens tutorial in web browser
```

Once the package is installed, you can further explore the functions by opening the HTML 'Vignette' located in the help files.

### Other notes

In order to use this package, you must have CIRCUITSCAPE installed.
Version 4.0 or higher is required.
