ResistanceGA 2.2-1
--------
* Fixed bug in multi-surface optimization function

ResistanceGA 2.2-0
--------
* Updated default transformation plot output
* Added pseudo R-squared measures to output tables of optimized surfaces
* Updated function for specifying continuous surface transformations. It is no longer necessary to specify this if all transformations are to be assessed.

ResistanceGA 2.1-0
--------
* Option to select specific transformations when optimizing

ResistanceGA 2.0-18
--------
* Updated Grid.Search function to use 'Resistance.Opt_single' function

ResistanceGA 2.0-17
--------
* Beta version with capability to run on Mac or Linux systems
* Updated sections of vignette

ResistanceGA 2.0-16
--------
* Optimization will proceed if NAs are generated by CIRCUITSCAPE; warning message generated.

ResistanceGA 2.0-15
--------
* Optimized categorical raster is now correctly saved to results file

ResistanceGA 2.0-14
--------
* Fixed error when running SS_optim with categorical surfaces

ResistanceGA 2.0-13
--------
* More detail is now printed at each iteration, providing the transformation, shape, and max parameters, in addition to AICc.

ResistanceGA 2.0-12
--------
* Fixed bug in 'Diagnostic.Plots' function.
* Updated warning messages

ResistanceGA 2.0-11
--------
* Fixed bug in 'Combine_Surfaces' function.

ResistanceGA 2.0-10
--------
* Updated CS.prep error message 

ResistanceGA 2.0-9
--------
* Fixed error in Diagnostic.Plot 
* Cleaned and consolodated code for conducting raster transformations
* Added functionality to use the advanced CIRCUITSCAPE feature of "pairs_to_include". This is not yet well documented, so contact me directly if you have interest in using this feature.

ResistanceGA 2.0-8
--------
* Fixed critical error in transformation functions. Inverse and Reverse functions were being rotated in space.

ResistanceGA 2.0-7
--------
* Fixed bug in `gdist_prep`
* Added more error messages to functions

ResistanceGA 2.0-6
--------
* Added more informative error messages to aid in troubleshooting and debugging

ResistanceGA 2.0-5
--------
* Updated `gdist.prep` to accept .txt, a matrix object, or a SpatialPoints object for sample locations

ResistanceGA 2.0-4
---------
* Fixed an error in Combine_Surfaces

ResistanceGA 2.0-3
---------
* GA.prep can now handle RasterLayer and RasterStack objects for optimization using least cost paths
* Added `rescale` feature to `Combine_Surfaces`. The default is TRUE, which will rescale the combined resistance surface so that the minimum resistance value is 1. This is accomplished by dividing by the minimum value in the resistance surface. This makes the comparison of optimized resistance surfaces easier since they often optimize to different solutions that are perfectly correlated in terms of relative resistance.
* It is now possible to use a sample point grid (.asc file) to specify spatial sample locations when using `CS.prep`. This format is exported by the 'export to CIRCUITSCAPE' tool in ArcGIS
* Fixed error in `Plot.trans` Reverse Monomolecular equation

ResistanceGA 2.0-2
---------
* Have tested and added the option to run optimization in parallel when using least cost paths. Set `parallel= TRUE` or `parallel = #cores` in `GA.prep`   
* PARALLEL DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK WHEN OPTIMIZING WITH CIRCUITSCAPE!!!

ResistanceGA 2.0-1
---------
* Updated how categorical resistance values are reported
* Updated examples in vignette to show how to optimize using cost distances and `gdistance`

ResistanceGA 2.0-0
---------
* Added option to optimize using cost distance (least cost paths), implemented using `gdistance`
 * `gdist.prep` and `Run_gdistance` functions
* Fixed error in `Run_CS`

ResistanceGA 1.0-3
---------
* Added data objects to run vignette
* Updated vignette to use the provided data

ResistanceGA 1.0-2
---------
* Fixed error in `MS_optim`
* Made change to correctly report AICc value from `MS_optim` in summary output
* Added figure to vignette
* Modified package depends and imports

ResistanceGA 1.0-1
---------
* Cleaned and consolidated code
* Expanded vignette
* Added option to `Run_CS` to return a `raster` object if `CurrentMap=TRUE`

ResistanceGA 1.0-0
---------
* All functions are fully documented
* Added `filled.contour` plot to `Grid.Search`
* Added Distance and Null model output options to `SS_optim`
* Vignette has been updated
