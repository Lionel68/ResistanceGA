ResistanceGA 2.0-2
---------
* Have tested and added the option to run optimization in parallel when using least cost paths. Set `parallel= TRUE` of `parallel = #cores` in `GA.prep`   
* PARALLEL DOES NOT CURRENTLY WORK WHEN OPTIMIZING WITH CIRCUITSCAPE!!!

ResistanceGA 2.0-1
---------
* Updated how categorical resistance values are reported
* Updated examples in vignette to show how to optimize using cost distances and `gdistance`

ResistanceGA 2.0-0
---------
* Added option to optimize using cost distance (least cost paths), implemented using `gdistance`
 * `gdist.prep` and `Run_gdistance` functions
* Fixed error in `Run_CS`

ResistanceGA 1.0-3
---------
* Added data objects to run vignette
* Updated vignette to use the provided data

ResistanceGA 1.0-2
---------
* Fixed error in `MS_optim`
* Made change to correctly report AICc value from `MS_optim` in summary output
* Added figure to vignette
* Modified package depends and imports

ResistanceGA 1.0-1
---------
* Cleaned and consolidated code
* Expanded vignette
* Added option to `Run_CS` to return a `raster` object if `CurrentMap=TRUE`

ResistanceGA 1.0-0
---------
* All functions are fully documented
* Added `filled.contour` plot to `Grid.Search`
* Added Distance and Null model output options to `SS_optim`
* Vignette has been updated
